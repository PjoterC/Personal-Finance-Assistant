# Personal-Finance-Assistant
University project - a simulation of a personal finance assistant program

Purpose
The program serves as a simulation of a personal finance assistant program with focus on interactions between classes and object oriented program structure. Users will be able to register personal and investment accounts that will store their history of money transfers. They will be able to evaluate their money flow by analysing transfer history in various ways – they can check which users they interacted with, what were their money transfers in a given time range and how their account balance changed in time. On personal accounts users will be able to register transfers from outer sources – not only other users’ accounts, while on investment accounts they can purchase and sell their stock assets. The program saves its state in txt files so that closing it will not force the user to input all data again.

*IMPORTANT*
Since there is no user input in the simulation, functions connected with logging in should be used with proprer parameters. Pre-written user data txt files are stored in the "PFAbuild" directory.
